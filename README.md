# Weather Forecast Server

This Go-based Weather Forecast Server utilizes two APIs for city localization and weather data retrieval: OpenAPI for geocoding and OpenAPI-Meteo for weather information. The server provides a simple and efficient way to obtain weather forecasts based on an input city string.

Main goal of this little project was to learn and get accustomed with Go syntax and API's requests.
